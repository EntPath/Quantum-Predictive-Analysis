# Quantum-Predictive-Analysis
This Repository is meant to showcase my work on Quantum Predictive algorithms and programs

Hi, I’m Tim Douglas, the creator behind Entangled Pathways. Over the years, I’ve developed quantum-based predictive programs that aim to help us be better prepared in critical areas—like financial markets, search-and-rescue, and even making sense of the lottery.

Cryptobot: Imagine being consistently 30 to 90 seconds ahead in cryptocurrency or stock trading. That’s what my cryptobot can achieve with its predictive analytics—potentially automating trades and optimizing profits. While the trading bot isn’t fully operational yet, the predictive core is functional and demonstrably accurate.

QDAR: On a different front, QDAR—or Quantum-Based Resonance Detection—uses quantum resonance to pinpoint missing artifacts or persons. Think of it as a form of quantum echo location. For instance, my program has offered insights into the potential location of MH370, demonstrating its vast applications in search-and-rescue and exploration.

Lotto Predictors: And for those who like numbers games, my lottery predictors analyze historical data to increase the chances of winning. These tools are functional and ready for market as a fun analytics product.

What I need now is a partner—someone with the resources to take these tools to the next level. Attached to this pitch is a PDF with detailed program overviews, outputs, and the resources required to move forward. Thank you for your time, and I’m excited to discuss this vision further.
